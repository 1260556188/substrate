//! A set of election algorithms to be used with a substrate runtime, typically within the staking
//! sub-system. Notable implementation include:
//!
//! - [`seq_phragmen`]: Implements the Phragm√©n Sequential Method. An un-ranked, relatively fast
//!   election method that ensures PJR, but does not provide a constant factor approximation of the
//!   maximin problem.
//! - [`balance_solution`]: Implements the star balancing algorithm. This iterative process can
//!   increase a solutions score.
//!
//! ### Terminology
